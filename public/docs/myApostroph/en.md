## User language [](#user-language)
The multilingual user interface offers the following languages:

## User / Superuser [](#user-rights)
You can sign in to myAPOSTROPH on behalf of your organisation as a

1. **User**: you see all the orders you yourself have placed
2. **Superuser**: you see all the orders placed by the users allocated to you

The contents of orders marked as confidential (separate checkbox on the order entry page) are visible only to the person placing the order. Superusers can see that an order has been placed, but not its contents. This provides an additional safeguard for your most sensitive orders. If you wish to have access as a Superuser, we can arrange this for you.

## Creating an order or requesting a quote [](#inquiries)
Use the relevant tile on the home screen for your input. ‘Create order’ automatically takes you to the details of your order.
