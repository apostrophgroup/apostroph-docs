**If you encounter any problems, please contact your personal project manager.**

### Creating an initial password [](#initial-pwd)

Once you have registered successfully, you have to define a password. To do so, go back to the welcome page (see [Access](#access)) and click **Forgotten your password?**. You will receive a link after following the instructions. Use this to create your own personal password.

### Changing your password [](#change-pwd)

You can change your password at any time in the main menu (see [Dashboard](#dashboard)) by clicking **Change password**.

### Forgotten your password [](#forgot-pwd)

If you have forgotten your password, you can ask for a new one at any time by clicking on **Forgotten your password?** on the welcome page (see [Access](#access)).

## User rights [](#user-rights)

You are registered either as a **user** or **superuser** on the myAPOSTROPH platform. The differences between these types of user are shown in the following table:

| Type of user| Description| Visibility of jobs | Standard jobs| Confidential jobs|
|----------|----------|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| User| Sees all the jobs he/she has placed| Only his/her own| All information| All information|
| Superuser| Sees all the jobs placed by the users allocated to him/her| Of all users allocated to him/her| All information| Only job number|

In the case of confidential jobs created by a **user**, the **superuser** only sees that an job has been created but has no access to any details. This provides an additional safeguard for your most sensitive jobs. To find out more about confidential jobs, please go to [Confidential jobs](#confidential-orders).

**If you would like to have superuser access, please contact your personal project manager.**

## Dashboard [](#dashboard)

The dashboard allows you to create new jobs or request quotes (see [Creating an job or requesting a quote](#orders)). It also provides an overview of recent jobs and their progress (see [Recent jobs](#last-orders)).

The Navigation menu is available to you at the top right. Here you can see a complete list of all your jobs (see [List of jobs](#orders-list)) as well as the menu for machine translation from myAPOSTROPH.ai (see [myAPOSTROPH.ai / machine translation](#machine-translation)).

### Recent jobs [](#last-orders)

The display of recent jobs makes it possible for you to maintain a good overview of the jobs placed and their progress. To display the details of an job all you need to do is click on it. If you would like to see all jobs, click **All**. This is how to open the list of jobs (see [List of jobs](#orders-list)).

## Creating an job or requesting a quote [](#orders)

You can create a new job on the dashboard or request a quote by clicking **Create job** or by clicking **+** via the main menu.

You can also request a quote any time before placing the job. To do so, just click **Request a quote**. Otherwise click **Submit job** to start the job.

### Frequent language [](#frequent-languages)

The most frequently used source and target languages of your jobs and requests are automatically detected by your browser and displayed as an initial selection. This makes navigation even faster.

### Confidential jobs [](#confidential-orders)

You can mark jobs as being **confidential**. Confidential jobs **cannot be seen by your superuser** (see [User rights](#user-rights)).

## List of jobs [](#orders-list)

The list of jobs shows all jobs. You can select display criteria using the **Filter** (see [Filters](#orders-filter)). The system makes an export to CSV format possible. Just click **Export list**.

**By default, the list shows all contracts from the last 12 months.**

### Filters [](#orders-filter)

Filters help you to find jobs more easily. The following search attributes are at your disposal:

* Job no. or title

* Target languages

* Status

* Order date

* Delivery deadline

  ![alt text][filter-orders]

**Superusers** (see [User rights](#user-rights)) have an additional filter with which they can see jobs from specific users.

**By default, only your own jobs are displayed. This filter has to be disabled to show all jobs.**

### Details

To display the details of an individual job all you need to do is click on it.

## Copying an job [](#copy-order)

For recurring jobs, we have included a function enabling you to copy an job. In this way, you can speed up the input process by copying all the information from your old job. To do so, open up a very similar job and click **Copy job**.
